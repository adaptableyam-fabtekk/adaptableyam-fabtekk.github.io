      <description>Our refurbishment service can provide clients with a viable, cost-effecitve option at a fraction of the price of acquiring new equipment. An initial evaluation will be conducted to assess the current condition and operational expectancy of the machine in question. An assessment of what can be realistically achieved will be discussed with the client.
Once the project is agreed, the dismantling process begins. This consists of our engineers carefully deconstructing the machinery, with the aim of replacing any failing parts, while keeping all operational parts intact and ready to be reused.</description>
