      <description>We offer a refurbishment service across all equipment; this provides customers a viable cost-effective option at a fraction of the price of acquiring new equipment.
In the first instance, an evaluation will be conducted to assess the current operational condition and the expectancy for the machineâ€™s performance. An assessment of what can be realistically achieved will be discussed with the customer. Once the project is agreed, a careful and methodical process of dismantling the machine occurs, and the refurbishment process begins to restore the equipment; offering new life to tired machinery, with the aim of bringing it back to a reliable and expected factory standard.</description>

      <description>Oven Cleaning, General Inspection and Condition Report Our engineers provide a concentrated clean of the oven, removing debris that presents a fire risk and impacts on output of the machine. Whilst undertaking the cleaning process we also do a visual oven inspection of both the oven chamber and the external oven walls and roof.
The internal inspection will highlight any findings that can pose an imminent risk of oven failure and identify those that present a medium risk, which can be rectified before a failure occurs, with remedial works and a planned shutdown.</description>

      <title>Preventative Maintenance</title>

      <guid>https://adaptableyam-fabtekk.github.io/services/preventative-maintenance/</guid>
      <description>Our engineering team is dedicated to ensuring the best possible performance of your machinery Through helping prolong its life expectancy by undertaking planned preventative maintenance schedules and rectifying problems that are uncovered.
Identifying and rectifying issues before they present themselves as breakdowns is a more cost-effective operating model than calling on service professionals in an emergency situation; unplanned downtime could jeopardise orders and reputation with customers.
A maintenance program allows organisations to budget accurately for parts and non-productive down time (budgeting for emergencies can be tricky), thus providing a level of control in the operation.</description>
